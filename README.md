### TASK 1: Prediction using Supervised ML
***
***Level: Beginner***
<br>Using simple linear regression model, forecasting the marks of a student based on the numbers of hours studied per day
<br>**Language:** *Python*
<br>**Platform:** *Google Colab*
<br>
<br>***The problem statement and the predictions that are to be made:***
1. Predict the percentage of marks of an student based on the number of study hours.
2. This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just 2 variables.
3. Data can be found at: http://bit.ly/w
4. You can use R, Python, SAS Enterprise Miner or any other tool.
5. What will be predicted score if a student studies for 9.25 hrs/ day?

### TASK 2: Prediction using Unsupervised ML
***
***Level: Beginner***
<br>Using K means clustering and sci-learn-kit the optimum number of clusters is visualized.
<br>**Language:** *Python*
<br>**Platform:** *Google Colab*
<br>
<br>***The problem statement and the predictions that are to be made:***
1. Predict the optimum number of clusters in the Iris dataset, and represent it visually.
2. You can use R or Python to complete this task.
